/*
Task:
You need to build an API for a virtual assistant that provides customized responses.

Requirements:
1. Create a GET endpoint at "/assistant/greet". 
2. The endpoint should accept a "name" as a query parameter (e.g., /assistant/greet?name=John).
3. The API should return a JSON response with:
   a. A personalized greeting using the name provided.
   b. A cheerful message based on the current day of the week.

Example Responses:
- For Monday:
  {
    "welcomeMessage": "Hello, John! Welcome to our assistant app!",
    "dayMessage": "Happy Monday! Start your week with energy!"
  }
- For Friday:
  {
    "welcomeMessage": "Hello, John! Welcome to our assistant app!",
    "dayMessage": "It's Friday! The weekend is near!"
  }
- For other days:
  {
    "welcomeMessage": "Hello, John! Welcome to our assistant app!",
    "dayMessage": "Have a wonderful day!"
  }

Add the required logic below to complete the API.
